## Description

Hooked on Movies is a react app that I built using OMDB API to learn more about the use of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) instead of the traditional life cycle methods.

### React Hooks Methods Used
* useState
* useEffect
* useReducer

## Future Iterations
1. Give it a bit more styling
2. Create a database for users to store movies they like
